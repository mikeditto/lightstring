This program is an "Arduino+NeoPixel Emulator".

It allows developing and testing simple Arduino sketches that produce
NeoPixel LED string displays and effects, running them on an ordinary
PC and showing them on the computer screen using SDL (Simple
DirectMedia Layer).

The Fake_NeoPixel class is a stripped-down copy of Adafruit_NeoPixel for
Arduino modified to use SDL2 as the rendering backend.  License: GPLv3

Some inspiration was taken from SDL tutorials by Lazy Foo' Productions.
